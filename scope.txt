Scope determines where your name is visible and directly accessible in your program

There are four different scopes in python:
    1. Built-in    
    2. Global
    3. Enclosed
    4. Local

LEGB Rule: Scope Resolution
Local: this is where the first search for a vairable is in the local scope
Enclosed: this is defined inside an enclosing or nested function
Global: is defined at the upper most level or simply outside functions
Built-In which is the keywords present in the built-in module
A variable declared inside a function is local, and the ones outside the scope of any function generally are global

Working with global variables as a default technique can turn our code into 
"Spaghetti Code" - named because it is messy
