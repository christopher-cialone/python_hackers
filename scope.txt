Scope determines where your name is visible and directly accessible in your program

There are four different scopes in python:
    1. Built-in    
    2. Global
    3. Enclosed
    4. Local

LEGB Rule: Scope Resolution
Local: this is where the first search for a vairable is in the local scope
Enclosed: this is defined inside an enclosing or nested function
Global: is defined at the upper most level or simply outside functions
Built-In which is the keywords present in the built-in module
A variable declared inside a function is local, and the ones outside the 
scope of any function generally are global

Working with global variables as a default technique can turn our code into 
"Spaghetti Code" - named because it is messy 

There are 2 keywords that can be used to change the scope of the
variables: Global and Non-Local:

    1. The Global keyword helps us access tge global variables from within the function. 

    2. Non-Local is a special type of scope defined in Python, that is used within
    the nested functions only in the condition tha it has been defined earlier in the enclosed 
    functions
