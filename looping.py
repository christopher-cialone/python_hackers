# First we declare a variable called str
# Recall that string in Python is a sequence
# Because a string is a sequence it can be iterated over
# A sequence is just an ordered set
# The variable item is essentially just a plaeholder that will store the current letter in sequence
# You can access any character in the sequence by its INDEX

# For Loop

str = 'Looping'

for item in str:
    print(item)
